I am an atmospheric scientist at GFDL/AOS program of Princeton University. I study clouds,  a complex system that is adaptive, resilient, self-organized, multi-scale, and filled with emergent properties. I am interested in many aspects of clouds including (1) the vertical air motions that form and maintain the clouds; (2) their underlying surfaces that feed moisture, energy, and mass to them; (3) their interactions with aerosols, the tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere, upon which cloud droplets form; and (4) how they respond and feed back to the large-scale meteorology. I use whatever tools that are appropriate to solve the problem: observations (satellite and experiments), theory (simple ones that capture the "coarse-grain" behavior), and numerical models (large-eddy model and GCM). 

I enjoy watching all kinds of sports (soccer, MMA, basketball, table tennis ...) although I am good at none of them.
